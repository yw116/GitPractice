# Commands from Git


### Basic routine for commiting

That is how I save a snapshot/point
```
git add <name of the file>
git commit -m "meaningful message"
```


### How to check the status of my files or directories in my git project

check if they are uncommited, unstaged, or untracked

`git status`

If you restore, you will delete your changes!!!
