- What is Git repository?
Git (repository) is a backup system where all versions of files are stored. New edits can be added to any previous version of a file.
Tool that accts in a specific directory, track chages in this directory.
Create a time-line with multiple versions of a project. 1 Git = 1 project = 1 new folder at the beginning.

- What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based Git repository. Git can be shared with other people on GitHub.

### Conceptual areas
- Developing area: The home folder where the project is developed. The folder where you initialize git.
- Local repository: The place where we prepare for committing, i.e. doing the commit command.
- Staging area: Location where to prepare new snapshots to the timeline. It is the .git directory. Used to put together the files that need to be committed together.

### Branches
You can create a branch so that editing tasks can be done simultaneously from a specific version without interfering each other. The new edits can be added by yourself or other people on new new branches. Branches can merge but they don't disappear after merge.

### Mirror effects
When working on different branches, new files created in one branch will only show up if you are in that branch. They will not show up if you switch to other branches.

### Fork
Copy a whole project from others' GitHub into my GitHub.
After editing, you can make a pull request to the original creator.
